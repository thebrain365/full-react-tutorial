This is a Full React tutorial on youtube by net ninja: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d

Firstly, I just want to give a huge thanks to Net Ninja for such a fantastic tutorial.

This tutorial was really easy to follow and it explained the concepts in a really good manner. In this tutorial I learnt what I'd like to call the core basics. We were creating a simple blog website which made use of a REST API.

After this tutorial I had a solid understanding of react as whole and how it can possibly be used to build a Single Page Application(SPA). I have a good understanding of what components and templates are, how they work, and also how they can be used.

We made use of controlled inputs (forms), click and submit events. In this tutorial I was also introduced to JSON Server and how it can make coding much easier in the development environment.

The part where I was really impressed the most was how he explained hooks in React. I had never done React before, so everything was new to me. After this toturial I felt that I was ready to go, and I understood every detail that he gave out. I learnt about the useEffect and useState hooks, and of course I learnt to create custom hooks.

The tutorial also explains very well how the React Router works. I learnt some good practices and how they can be used. I also learnt about using props in order to pass around data to components.

This was a good tutorial overall and I was able to understand React in a way that I can start building react applications.
